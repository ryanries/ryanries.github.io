<h1>Test-RPC v1.1</h1>
<p>October 26th, 2023</p>
<p>Way back in 2014, which I refer to as my 'sysadmin days,' before I worked at Microsoft, I once worked at a place with an extremely complex network. Probably
too complex for its own good, now that I think about it. I was in charge of designing, deploying and maintaining Active Directory back then, and one of the tasks involved
was submitting requests to our network team to open the necessary firewall ports for my domain controllers to communicate with each other and with clients.
I'm sure most AD admins can relate. The network engineers found my requests for the dynamic RPC port range especially vexing, and they rarely got it right on the first try.</p>
<p>That led me to create the Test-RPC PowerShell script. If you search the web for "rpc port test," chances are you'll run across it, perhaps on the venerable 
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/testing-rpc-ports-with-powershell-and-yes-its-as-much-fun-as-it-sounds/">Doctor Scripto blog</a>. There was a similar script
available at the time, but it had a dependency on a separate tool, PortQry.exe, and I was pretty sure I could do it without any added dependencies.</p>
<p>When I first joined Microsoft in 2015, I was making customer direct calls as a Support Escalation Engineer. I remember feeling pretty awkward when a customer asked
for me by name over the phone. I was still pretty new and I didn't know this guy...</p>
<p><i>"I wanna talk to Ryan Ries,"</i> he says.</p>
<p><i>"Uh, speaking?"</i> I respond.</p>
<p><i>"Yeah I just wanted to let you know, your Test-RPC script? It sucks! It doesn't work!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Oh... I'm... sorry? Well let's take a look at it and see what the problem is..."</i></p>
<p>After going through the whole screen sharing rigmarole and letting him show me my own PowerShell script... I quickly ascertained that the issue was that this guy
had never run the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet that would allow him to run PowerShell scripts on his system.</p>
<p>That was it. That was the entire issue. I hope he gave me a good customer survey.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the PowerShell team at Microsoft created the PowerShell gallery, and the creators were going around soliciting for submissions because PS Gallery was brand new at the time.
So I uploaded <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Test-RPC/1.0">Test-RPC 1.0 there</a>. Today I looked at it again for the first time in years and I see it
sitting at almost a quarter million downloads!</p>
<p>There was always one thing about the Test-RPC script that I didn't like. The script lets you know whether every port advertised by the Endpoint Mapper is open or not,
but it only reports either "yes all ports are open," or "no not all ports are open." But the script doesn't ever tell you which specific port or ports it was unable to reach. So we are
well due for a version 1.1 of the Test-RPC script, aren't we!?</p>
<p>Without further ado, I have uploaded Test-RPC v1.1 to the PowerShell Gallery <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Test-RPC/1.1.0">here</a>!</p>
<p>You can also just run Install-Script Test-RPC to download it from PSGallery! (Or Update-Script, if you already have it downloaded.)</p>
<p>Then, run Get-InstalledScript Test-RPC | FL to find the location where the script was saved. (C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts by default.)</p>
<p>Then, dot-source the script to load it into memory: PS> . "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts\Test-RPC.ps1"</p>
<p>Then, to see the full help for the cmdlet: PS> Get-Help Test-RPC -Full -Category Function</p>
<p>Here is the updated comment-based help from the Test-RPC cmdlet to give you an idea of what's been updated:</p>

    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests RPC connectivity to a remote server over the port 135 endpoint mapper as well as the ephemeral ports advertised by the EPM.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This script tests TCP network connectivity to not just the RPC Endpoint Mapper on port 135, but it also checks TCP network connectivity to each of the registered endpoints returned by querying the EPM.
    I wrote this because many firewall teams have a difficult time with RPC, and they will end up allowing the Endpoint Mapper on port 135, but forget to also allow the ephemeral ports through the firewall.
    This script uses localhost by default, but obviously you can specify a remote machine name or IP address to test a server across the network. The script works by P/Invoking functions exported from rpcrt4.dll
    to get an enumeration of registered endpoints from the endpoint mapper, so it's not just a wrapper around portqry.exe and this script does not require portqry.exe.

    Latest update: 26 Oct. 2023 - the script can now tell you exactly which port(s) responded. Also fixed a bug where duplicate attempts to validate the same port were being made.
