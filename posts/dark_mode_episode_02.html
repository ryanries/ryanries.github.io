<p>After a long hiatus, I've finally posted episode 2 of my YouTube series DARK MODE,
    the show where we do sketchy stuff with computers!</p>
<p>In this episode, we're taking a look at some enterprise software that uses a technique that
    a malware author would be proud of, and abuses the structured exception handling system to run arbitrary code!</p>
