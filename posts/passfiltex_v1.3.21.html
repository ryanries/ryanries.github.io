<p>October 29th, 2024</p>
<p>I released a new version of my Active Directory password filter today: <a href="https://github.com/ryanries/PassFiltEx/releases/tag/v1.3.21">PassFiltEx v1.3.21.</a></p>
<p>Highlights of this release include:</p>
<p>1) Completely removed ETW logging and moved to basic text file logging. After all these years, I am finally admitting publicly that I was just trying to be a cool Windows guru and that I was just being sadistic by trying to force people to use ETW. Nobody wants to use ETW. ETW has its uses but it's really awful for when you really just want a log file. The new log file is \Windows\System32\PassFiltEx.log and the log is rotated after it reaches 1MB. By default only error messages are logged, but if you use the Debug registry setting in the PassFiltEx subkey, it will enable additional informational messages. Updated the README with this information.</p>
<p>2) Added a "BlockSequentialChars" setting. This setting adds the ability to block passwords if they contain 3 or more sequential characters such as ABC or abc or 123 or def or 456, etc. This setting was added at the request of user "L Kang".</p>
<p>Please do give it a try (you can use the included PassFiltExTest.exe test harness to simplify testing if you like) and let me know if you need any features added.</p>
<p>I've gotten several emails over the years of people using my password filter at their jobs with great results.</p>
