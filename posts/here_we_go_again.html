<p>I've blogged on and off since the late '90s. It was a much different internet back then, and I was a much different person back then. Sometimes
I self-hosted and wrote everything from scratch in Notepad, sometimes I just used Wordpress. Thanks to the permanence of archive.org, I can still embarrass 
myself by revisiting all those old blogs and cringing at my past self. All I can do is try to use that self-reflection to improve my future self. This latest
foray into blogging was primarily inspired by my retiring from Twitter, and by trying to reduce the amount of social media I consume in general.</p>
<p>So here we are, starting over yet again. I'm going to be posting mostly technical musings about Microsoft Windows, Active Directory, low-level programming,
etc.. I'll try to make the content useful. No promises that the occasional post about food or raising a toddler won't sneak in every once in a while.</p>
