<p>November 20th, 2023</p>
<p>Secure Time Seeding is a feature of the Windows Time service (w32time) that was introduced with Server 2016.</p>
<p>The feature is documented in a couple of places, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-server-2016-improvements">but primarily here.</a></p>
<p>There was also an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/windows-feature-that-resets-system-clocks-based-on-random-data-is-wreaking-havoc/">Ars Technica article</a> published recently in which one of my Twitter tweets was quoted:</p>
<img src="posts/images/2023/ststweet1.png" title="Tweet on STS" alt="Tweet on STS">
<p><b>Please, I'm begging you, turn off Secure Time Seeding on your Windows Servers.</b></p>
<p>STS was created to correct <i>egregious</i> time skews on devices such as laptops and tablets that drain their batteries and wake up with their clocks grossly incorrect.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it was a mistake on the PG's part to leave STS enabled by default on Server SKUs.</p>
<p>The second mistake was allowing STS to override NTP. Additionally, STS does not adhere to max phase correction (for good reason: it's <i>designed</i> to correct time skews of days, months or years) so it will set your clocks way, <i>way</i> off into the future or past.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Microsoft documentation does state this, or at least implies it, but in a very soft-spoken way:</p>
<blockquote>"In deployments with a reliable time source(s) and well monitored machines that include monitoring for time offsets, 
you may choose to not use the Secure Time Seeding feature and rely on your existing infrastructure instead.
...
If your domain has portable slim laptops/tablets and other devices, you may want to exclude such machines from this policy
change. These devices will eventually face battery drain and need the Secure Time Seeding feature to bootstrap their time."</blockquote>
<p>The documentation is telling you that if you have a secure time source (i.e. if your NTP servers work,) you do not need and should not use STS. Though the documentation only implies it. The documentation is not beating you about the head and neck with a blunt object and demanding you explicitly turn it off. That's what I'm doing right now.</p>
<p>The problem is it's still enabled by default, even for servers. Even on domain controllers. And it definitely should not be.</p>
<p>STS works by reading the timestamp field from incoming TLS handshakes. (Specifically, gmt_unix_time in the handshake.) But STS na√Øvely assumes the timestamp field in these TLS handshakes contains a valid timestamp. In reality, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246">per RFC,</a> this timestamp field is not required to contain a valid timestamp, and indeed, some implementations of TLS will put random data in that field. STS will interpret that as a date that's months or years off and set the clock to a very incorrect time, overriding NTP.</p>
<p>An excerpt from RFC 5246, the TLS 1.2 specification:</p>
<img src="posts/images/2023/rfc5246.png" title="RFC 5246" alt="RFC 5246">
<p>TLS wasn't designed as a time keeping protocol so the contents of gmt_unix_time aren't important to the success of a TLS connection.</p>
<p>STS assumes that since we trust the TLS endpoint because it presented a trusted TLS certificate, that we also implicitly trust the time that was populated in the timestamp field in the TLS handshake. But in fact that timestamp could be random data, or just a very incorrect time. STS doesn't know any better. It just trusts whatever it finds there in that timestamp field.</p>
<p>There are complex algorithms in w32time that will try to achieve a quorum of such samples, such that we won't set the system clock based on a single bad sample. But if the system sees a majority of wonky time samples, the algorithm can be fooled.</p>
<p>I've seen several cases of customers having terrible production impact because STS skewed the time on their machines incorrectly. Often even on AD domain controllers. Don't need to explain how much havoc that can cause.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the whole gmt_unix_time field is deprecated in TLS 1.3, so as TLS 1.3 adoption increases, STS becomes increasingly irrelevant!</p>
<p>Lately it seems it has been getting worse. The question from several customers is, why is STS wrecking us now when it wasn't doing it before?</p>
<p>Correlating the w32time debug log with CAPI2 logs (SSL certificate validations) may give you a hint. But the truth is, there usually isn't enough instrumentation in the w32time service to know for sure. Most of the time we're left trying to assuage the customer with an explanation of what <i>probably</i> happened.</p>
<p>The explanation that would make the most sense is that there has been an introduction of devices on your network recently that put random data into the timestamp field of TLS packets, such as non-Windows devices and/or non Schannel-based TLS implementations.</p>
<p>If you have reliable NTP servers, then turn it off. At least on your servers. You don't need it. Instructions on how to do that are in the aforementioned Microsoft KB article.</p>
<p>This is a developing situation. There will be more updates to the official Microsoft docs. There may be improvements to the logging and/or instrumentation to help customers and Microsoft Support troubleshoot issues. But this blog post is not official Microsoft communication. This is just my 
personal blog.</p>
